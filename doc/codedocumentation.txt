If you want to take a look behind the scenes, youÂ´re at the right place.


Code Style

We are using modules instead of putting all together in one giant script. Most modules can be recycled for future projects, only a few not.


Client-Server Communication

The data has to be transferred from the client to the server and back. We use self written modules to communicate, so we can use top-level functions in our top-level scripts. The loop:

The client sends the server the command
The server executes the command and sends TCP chunks with the result back to the client
The client is receiving the data in 8192kB chunks
The client is putting the chunks into a final string
